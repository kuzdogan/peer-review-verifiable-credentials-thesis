# Veriview: A Peer Review sharing and aggregation platform

Veriview is a peer review sharing and aggregation platform using Verifiable Credentials. Allows selective disclosure of review attributes, thus enabling sharing verified reviews without violating blinded review information and requiring a third-party review verifier.
